I am a very passionate woman, I love being creative, not much of a content writer but I love writing and I'm someone who is always ready to learn new things, and also share ideas. 
I admire people with great vision, people with a great sense of humour, and people who have similar dreams to mine. 
I have always had this zeal of becoming an independent courageous orientated woman, one whom others can look up to and value as a role model. 
A couple of years ago, I picked and developed interest in technology, and now I all dream of is, how to become a 'Tech Practitioner' and how to make tech education accessible to other young aspiring ones and help them achieve the same aim. 
I am the honest type, I'm emotionally intelligent, less dramatic and quite loyal.
